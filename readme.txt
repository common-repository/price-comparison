== Description ==
Adds price comparison to woocommerce and wordpressThe Wordpress Price Comparison plugin lets you add price comparison from any source of prices for a product you can find on the web.

It works in conjunction with WooCommerce and adds new URL boxes to your WooCommerce Product pages in the admin area - simply paste in the URL for each price source you have (e.g. Amazon or eBay) and now when users visit your product page, the price comparison plugin will check prices from those sources live for your users.

This plugin integrates with Skimlinks, so simply enter your Skimlinks ID and you\'ll earn money for any sales made through these price comparison links. Skimlinks can be used to monetize any other exit links you have on your site automatically if you install their Skimlinks Wordpress plugin but that\'s not needed for this price comparison plugin to work.

**Installation**
Upload the ZIP file and activate the plugin. Visit the settings page to enter your Skimlinks account number. Getting a Skimlinks account number is easy and can be done here.

**Configuring Products**
Visit your product pages in Woocommerce and paste in the URL for a page on the web where your users can buy this product (and which contains a price). The price comparison plugin will do the rest and will fetch that price live every time your users visit your product page. This means your users no longer have to go out and check all these places manually making your website far more useful to them.

**Wordpress Price Comparison Pro**
There is a professional version of this plugin which has premium support and access to more features. You can find out more about Wordpress Price Comparison Pro here.
